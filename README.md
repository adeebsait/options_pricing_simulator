# Options Pricing Simulator

This project is a Python-based tool for simulating and pricing options using two widely-used methods:
1. **Black-Scholes Model**: A mathematical formula for pricing European options.
2. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: A numerical approach that simulates stock price paths to estimate the option price.

## Features
- Implements the Black-Scholes model for call and put options.
- Uses Monte Carlo simulations to handle more complex pricing scenarios.
- Visualises option prices against various parameters like spot price and volatility.

## Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
